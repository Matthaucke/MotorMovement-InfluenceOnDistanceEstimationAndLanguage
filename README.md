# MotorMovement-InfluenceOnDistanceEstimationAndLanguage
This study  investigates whether motor movement does affect subsequent comprehension of language and estimation of distance

This experiment investigates whether motor movement influences language comprehension and distance estimation (Glenberg, Sato & Cattaneo, 2008). In this experiment are 4 groups: one groups that must move the object from the lower part of the screen to the upper part, and another group must move the object from the lower part of the screen to the upper part. This should stimulate either hand movement away or towards the body. On top of that, participants in one groups must decide which symbol he/she has to drag; this cognitive load should reduce the expected motor movement effects. This results will be compared to a group that must move the objects without cognitive load.
